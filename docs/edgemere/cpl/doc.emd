The Common Physical Layer (CPL) contains abstractions that allow for better management across an ecosystem inside the  
data center, in the cloud, and on the edge devices. These abstractions give the ability to manage a highly variable  
hardware configurations by describing the common operating and taxonomy of the devices. This architectural layer has the  
the goal of addressing the following characteristics:

*   Common Taxonomy
*   Portability and Interoperability
*   Security and Root of Trust
*   Common Management Control Plane
*   Performance Optimization
*   Stability and Reliability
*   Flexibility and Agility

The CPL sits at the bottom of the Architectural stack and is the foundation for all of the other layers of the  
architecture. It relies on [Security](package--edgemere-sa) and [Identifying](package--edgemere-ia) aspects to  
establish the hardware root of trust, identity, and data encryption at the lowest levels.

The CPL establishes a taxonomy of generalized hardware devices. This makes it easier to create standard services  
and operating models for the devices. This includes devices in Public Clouds, Private Clouds, Legacy Infrastructure, and  
Edge Devices. These devices have standard [hardware](class-hardware): [compute](class-computehardware), [storage](class-storagehardware), [network](class-networkhardware), and [accelerators](class-acceleratorshardware). Understanding that each [device](class-device) can have a unique set of capabilities delivered from the device's special hardware is key to establishing a common management control plane.

The critical element in this layer is the [Device](class-device). It is represented by a model that contains  
several [hardware](class-hardware) elements. The [device](class-device) has a profile that shows the device's capabilities [device](class-device) and [hardware,](class-hardware) as well as the current capacity of  
the [device](class-device). The [device](class-device) is has a simple interface for control and telemetry up to  
the [software-defined infrastructure layer - SDI](package--edgemere-sdi) so [applications](class-application)  
and [services](class-service) can be deployed to the [device](class-device) and its (hardware)\[class-hardware\].

With the explosion of IoT devices, the complexity of managing the devices in conjunction with devices in the  
cloud and the data center. Addressing a large number of devices can become overwhelming for  
[IT operations engineer](actor-itops) as well as any automated IT management system. For this reason, the architect has  
created an element called the [Aggregated Device](class-aggregateddevice). That allows for grouping devices into  
collections to be managed and controlled as a group instead of as individual  
devices. [Aggregated devices](class-aggregateddevice) can contain [devices](class-device) or  
other [aggregated devices](class-aggregatedevice), giving the ability to have an infinite number of layers in the hierarchy of devices.

In this example, a topology of devices has been established to give the [IT operations engineer](actor-itops)  
the ability to manage all of the devices connected to a data center. In "Data Center 1"  
there are 4 Edge Devices; Data Center 2 has 4 Edge Devices, and Data Center 3 has an Aggregated Edge Device and a normal  
Device. Aggregation of devices can happen along with geographic, device capabilities, security profiles, etc... The key is  
that the topology is established to help with the physical management of the devices.

![CPL Topology](./cpltopology.png)

Many times organizations combine the physical management and the logical management of devices. Combining the  
Cloud topology and the Control Topology together. This architecture separates the two topologies giving the flexibility  
to establish clouds that span multiple physical domains. Including setting a cloud that spans resources in data  
centers, public clouds, and edge devices. Providing the ability to schedule and manage applications and services across  
traditional boundaries.

![CPL Cloud topology](./cplcloudtopology.png)

This example shows three clouds that share devices and span the control topology established for  
optimized IT operations. This flexibility allows clouds (logical devices) to adapt to changing environments. Theses  
changes can include everything from cyber threats, physical disasters, partial connectivity of edge devices, or even  
someone tripping over a network connection in the data center.


## Physical Asset Management

In the realm of physical asset management, understanding the intrinsic value and functionality of assets is paramount. Whether it's machinery, infrastructure, or equipment, assets form the backbone of any operational setup. Here's a detailed exploration of the key concepts and considerations in this domain:

### Importance of Assets

Assets are the lifeblood of an organization, representing tangible resources critical for its operations. Identifying the most crucial assets is fundamental, as they underpin productivity, efficiency, and overall success. Moreover, integrating people into the infrastructure involves recognizing how individuals interact with these assets. This integration ensures that human resources are optimally utilized and aligned with asset management strategies.

### Digitization of Assets

Digitizing the enterprise involves transitioning from traditional, physical processes to digital solutions. This transformation enables seamless integration of physical assets into digital frameworks, facilitating better monitoring, management, and analysis. By bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds, organizations can unlock new opportunities for efficiency and innovation.

### Characteristics of Assets

- **Sensors**: Assets are equipped with sensors that capture real-world data. These sensors convert physical phenomena into analog signals, which are subsequently digitized for processing and analysis.

- **Communication Pathway**: Establishing a communication pathway is crucial for transmitting data from sensors to digital systems. Whether through wired or wireless connections, this pathway ensures that asset data can be accessed and utilized effectively.

- **Control of the Physical World**: Some assets manipulate the physical world through mechanisms that change position, temperature, electrical current, magnetism, or any other physical characteristic. These assets play a vital role in various industries and processes.

### Types of Assets

1. **No Sensors and No Communication Pathway**: Some assets, like railway switches or compressors, may lack built-in sensors or communication capabilities. In such cases, adding a communication gateway and appropriate sensors is necessary to enable data collection and connectivity.

2. **Sensors with No Communication Pathway**: Assets may have internal sensors that gather data but lack external connectivity. To leverage this data for analysis and decision-making, establishing a communication pathway becomes essential.

3. **Sensor with Communication Pathway**: Ideally, assets should be equipped with both sensors and a communication pathway, allowing real-time data transmission to digital systems for analysis and action.

### PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)

PLCs serve as the bridge between physical assets and digital devices. These controllers facilitate communication, data exchange, and control functions, enabling seamless integration of assets into digital networks.

### Use Cases

- **Monitoring**: Assets can be used to monitor physical processes, conditions, and performance metrics in real-time.

- **Control**: They can also exert control over physical processes, enabling automation and optimization of operations.

- **Connectivity**: Establishing connectivity between physical assets and digital devices enables data exchange, remote monitoring, and control.

- **Management**: Efficient management of physical assets involves tasks such as maintenance, repair, and lifecycle planning.

- **Security**: Securing both the physical assets themselves and the data they generate is critical to prevent unauthorized access, tampering, or data breaches.

By leveraging the capabilities of physical assets and integrating them into digital ecosystems, organizations can enhance operational efficiency, improve decision-making, and unlock new opportunities for innovation and growth.
