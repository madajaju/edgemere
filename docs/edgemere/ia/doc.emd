The Identity Aspect is used through all layers in the Architecture. This aspect is responsible for the trusted
identity of users; device in the data center, in the cloud, and on the edge; services and applications; and data.
Having a common indentity management system is key to having consistency in the system. Having that identity
trusted means that I can establish a trusted ecosystem in which data, applications and hardware can deliver
solutions that can be trusted.

The Identity Aspect has key sub-systems that help in managing identity: Access, Authorization, Authentication and
Key Management. Being able to Authenticate an entity in the system is the first step in identity management. Keys
are used to certify and attest the authentication of an entity, human or machine. Once an entity is authenicated,
it is given authority to access other resources in the system. By giving identity ot every element in the system,
mishaps in security can be mitigated and better controlled.
