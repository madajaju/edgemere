# Stack Developer

The Stack Developer, abbreviated `stackdev`, is an integral part of the development process within the organization. The core function of this actor is to construct reusable micro-services and application stacks. 

## Primary Responsibilities

Stack Developer's duties encompass a wide gamut of activities, but the primary ones are:

1. Manipulating service and application stacks by creating, updating, and deleting as per requirements.
2. Presiding over the policies governing the services attached to these stacks.
3. Coordinating the smooth functioning of services across different environments.
4. Retaining the overall architecture's integrity by closely monitoring stacks and the services they contain.

# Use Cases Interaction

## Manage Environment

An essential role of the Stack Developer is setting up environments for services to function. The Stack Developer also frames policies that control the functioning of services within that environment, including security protocols, network configurations, and access controls.

## Manage Stacks

As part of 'Manage Stacks', the Stack Developer has the responsibility to construct, update, and eliminate both application stacks and service stacks. This can involve tailoring the stack's elements, scheduling, or concluding the operation of a stack based on requirements.

## Manage Services

In 'Manage Services', the Stack Developer develops reusable components that come together to form the micro-services. Defining service parameters, coordinating service dependencies, and identifying potential efficiencies in service execution forms a border part of this use case.

## Coordinate Services

In 'Coordinate Services', the Stack Developer ensures there is a seamless flow of data across different services within a stack. This role involves harmonizing service APIs, integrating services, and managing interdependencies between these services.

# Scenarios Interaction

The Stack Developer plays a critical role in several organizational scenarios:

1. **Create Application Stack & Service Stack:** Stack Developer is responsible for creating new application stacks and service stacks to fit the organization's evolving needs.
   
2. **Modify Application Stack & Service Stack:** Stack Developer updates or alters existing stacks to ensure they align with any changes in the organization's requirements.
   
3. **Test Application Stack & Service Stack:** As part of the quality assurance process, the Stack Developer conducts testing on the stacks they've built to ensure optimal functionality.
   
4. **Version Service Stack:** This involves creating different versions of service stacks, marking each significant change made.
   
5. **Build Service:** The Stack Developer constructs services that conform to the specified deliverables. The services, once built, will then be deployed as part of a larger application or service stack.

The Stack Developer is instrumental in ensuring the continuous optimization and efficacy of the application stacks and reusable microservices in the organization's software architecture.
