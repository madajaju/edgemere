# Data

This class represents data that is stored in the system. It has a relationship with a StorageResource as all data must have someplace to reside. The access attribute is a catch all for how to access the data. It could be a connection string to a data like a database, a filesystem etc.. Specializations of the Data reference class know what to do with the access attribute.
