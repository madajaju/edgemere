# Workload 

The `Workload` class belongs to the Application Management Layer (AML) package. AML is designed to optimize and streamline application development, DevOps, and IT Operations, managing intricate workflows and applications through their lifecycle. 

`Workload` encapsulates a set of applications that operate based on established business rules, subject to specific Service Level Agreements (SLA) and Quality of Service (QoS) provisions. Its interactive function with groups of applications makes it a critical element within application management. 

In terms of its position in the system architecture, `Workload` directly interacts with the Distributed Information Management Layer and the Service Management Layer. It also utilises the Identity Aspect and Security Aspect layers, enhancing the coordination and protection aspects. 

Likewise, this class is instrumental in connecting with AI/ML Solutions, bringing forth their efficiencies into mainstream workflows by orchestrating their integration. `Workload` also interacts with the SecDevOps suite, promoting the use of Automation Frameworks, CICD tools, and Environment Management. 

These associations allow `Workload` to harness the strength of various tools and services, reinforcing the AML's primary objective.
