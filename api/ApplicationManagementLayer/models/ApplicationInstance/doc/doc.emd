# ApplicationInstance Class

**Package:** aml

The `ApplicationInstance` class belongs to the `aml` package, which is a component of the Application Management Layer (AML). This layer manages complex workflows and applications throughout the application development lifecycle.

Specifically, the `ApplicationInstance` class represents a running instance of an application in the ecosystem. It is essentially a component of an application that has been instantiated, therefore indicating that it is currently active and in use. 

The class provides methods to create, modify, and destroy these instances, which are vital functionalities in application lifecycle management. These methods include `create`, `update`, `destroy`, `addTo`, and `removeFrom`.

Beyond its stand-alone functionalities, the `ApplicationInstance` class plays a significant role as it interacts with other classes in the system architecture, specifically with the `Application` class, defined as an association named `app`.

In the broader architecture, the class interfaces directly with the Distributed Information Management Layer and the Service Management Layer, reinforcing its significance in managing the system's application instances. 

Underneath `ApplicationInstance`, it also benefits from lower layers such as the Identity Aspect and Security Aspect, indicating that application instances will have associated identity and security features.

In summary, the `ApplicationInstance` class is a key part of managing applications throughout their lifecycle, enabling the creation, updating, and termination of application instances within the system architecture.
