# `Application` Class Summary

The `Application` class resides in the robust Application Management Layer (AML) and acts as a pivotal interface for managing and orchestrating applications and workflows. It offers extensive support to App Development, DevOps, and IT Operations teams, aiding them to manage sophisticated workflows and applications across different life cycle stages. 

## Operational Scope

The utility of the `Application` class is instrumental in the application management lifecycle, providing core functions for the creation, destruction, updating, adding to, and removing from an application. It forms an integral part of the application architecture and offers a comprehensive set of functions to interact with and manage applications. 

## Association Paradigm

The `Application` class also fosters associations with other components to enhance the operation spectrum. It interacts with `workloads` to represent the tasks at hand, `stacks` to manage the technological constructs within an application, `data` to handle data references, and `instances` to manage specific occurrences of the `Application` class.

## Layer Interactions

The `Application` class shares interaction channels with the Distributed Information Management Layer (DML) and the Service Management Layer (SML), assisting in the data management and service provisions. It also exploits resources from the Identity Aspect and Security Aspect layers, taking care of the identity authentication and security aspects of an application.

## Integration Facility

From a broader perspective, the `Application` class provides high-level application and workflow orchestration and creates a definition framework for varied applications. Its integration with SecDevOps through SecDevOps Services facilitates efficient environment management and other vital services for smooth workflow and application integration.

To summarize, the `Application` class delivers an all-encompassing infrastructure that supports the development, management, and integration of applications in the system. This dynamic class covers the entire spectrum of application management, right from the creation stage till its destruction.
