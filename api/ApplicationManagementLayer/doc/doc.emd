The package documentation elaborates on the Application Management Layer (AML) which forms an important component in managing complex workflows and applications through the application development lifecycle. 

Based on the identified use cases, the AML contains key functionalities for managing AI models, applications, and workloads. IT professionals such as DevOps engineers, application developers, data engineers, and data scientists are the primary actors who interact with the AML, utilizing different methods to perform distinct use cases. 

The use case 'Manage AI Models' outlines how a Data Scientist manages AI models in coordination with DevOps to ensure that both the AI models and applications are updated together. The scenarios within this use case cover actions like creating, deploying, destroying, and updating AI models. 

In the 'Manage Applications' use case, DevOps Engineers and Application Developers collaborate to manage applications across multiple platforms. The operations within this use case include building, creating, deploying, destroying, monitoring, and updating the applications.

The use case 'Manage Workloads' enables Application Developers to interconnect applications through workflows, thereby automating complex data interactions between various applications across a hybrid infrastructure. The included operations are creating, deploying, destroying, monitoring, and updating the workloads. 

Within the AML package, we have several key classes including Application, Application Instance, Application Template, Workload, Workload Instance, and Workload Template. Each of these classes provides methods for managing their instances, including operations like creating, destroying, adding to, updating, and removing from the instances. 

Furthermore, there are defined workflows for managing AI models, applications, and workloads. These workflows illustrate the sequential actions, conditions, and transitions between different states for each operation, specifying the actors responsible for each action and the outcome of their activities. 

Overall, the AML provides a comprehensive management system for AI models, applications, and workloads, connecting different users and their actions in an organized, modular manner.
