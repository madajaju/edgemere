The Security Aspect is used in every layer of the architecture. The aspect was developed such that all layers in the
architecture has a common mechanism to perform common security use cases, such as, encryption, detection, remediation,
and root of trust.

Because security spans all of the layers the aspect also coordinates the use cases across the layers.
